            <h1>Oops i hired a North Korean Hacker!</h1>
            <img src="knowbe4.jpg" alt="The North Korean Hacker in question." width="40%" height="auto" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
            <time datetime="2025-02-10"></time>
    <h1>The absolute state of Cybersecurity companies.</h1>
    <p>
    First a disclaimer the <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us">company</a> in question that hired the North Korean hacker did do so out of incompetence but it was not on a level out of the norm seen in the Cybersecurity industry. As such they should not be unduly stigmatized or discriminated against as less competent than the industry standard. In fact the fact they were willing to come forward and publicize their Cybersecurity incidents is upstanding behavior that should be rewarded and additionally something else to their credit the incident did not lead to significant damages.</p>
<p> That being said it should not have happened in the first place. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-north-korean-nationals-and-three-facilitators-indicted-multi-year-fraudulent-remote">Especially since there was ample warning coming from the US government about the problem at the time.</a> However due to the general industry standardization around the hiring process and the lack of specific guidance around how to amend those standards and properly resolve this problem. The issue is bound to reoccur without the specific required attention on the part of each and every organization to resolve this problem. This is infeasible as such even in the Cybersecurity industry these things occur simply because there are too many things to pay attention to. So what do we do to fix it? Standardization. More specifically the idea of sane defaults and by extension secure defaults. Now despite the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_and_Infrastructure_Security_Agency">CISA</a> publishing about the concept in <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/principles_approaches_for_security-by-design-default_508_0.pdf">2023</a> this is not a new concept rather it is extremely old dating back to at least <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec06/tech/full_papers/casado/casado_html/">2006</a>.
    </p>
<p>Then why are we still beating this horse and how has it not died yet after 17 years of continuous beatings?</p>
<h1>Because this is one tough horse.</h1>
<p>It’s a composite of three problems, people forgetting about sane defaults, insufficient standards and proprietary software.</p>
<p>
One of these alone is a problem combine all three and you get this <a href="https://samcurry.net/hacking-millions-of-modems">this unholy abomination</a>.</p>
<p>Sam Curry is a very competent hacker and Cybersecurity professional and yet you see him get hacked through no real fault of his own. And like the example with KnowBe4, Cox is not particularly at fault here or negligent when it comes to comparing it to the objectively terrible standard of the way that ISP/Internet Service providers behave. They did at least resolve the issue when it was reported though their responsible disclosure program (<a href="https://samcurry.net/hacking-millions-of-modems#three-years-later">even if it took three years to do so from the first time it was disclosed</a>). But ignoring that glaring problem what was the root cause here? Well Cox had a misconfigured server running a cox specific non standard software and Sam had a proprietary router that he had no control over and thus could not fix any of the issues with it. And there we go we have the three horsemen of the cybersecurity apocalypse combining to create an insane, nonstandard, proprietary software stack severely lacking in sane defaults. Had any one of these been changed my boy Sam Curry here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry">Basketball player unrelated</a>) would likely not have had his router compromised and not been spied on.</p>
<h1>Now what’s the solution?</h1>
<p>The industry standard solution as i have been saying and as has been for the past 17+ years is a greater push for sane defaults in our standards and processes to, from and for the Cybersecurity industry and everyone else. But that has only kind of worked...</p>
<h1>What’s my solution?</h1>
Open source. Open source EVERYTHING and I am not the only one to think like that there has been a <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">significant push</a> from the state department for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">SBOM’s (software bill of materials)</a> and access to source code as a condition for specific contracts. If the government is pushing for it to solve their Cybersecurity issues so should the Cybersecurity industry to solve our own Cybersecurity issues. Beacause if we can at least knock down the proprietary angle of the three horsemen of the cybersecurity apocalypse it makes it a lot easier to solve the other two.</p>
<p>Because if we can’t secure ourselves how can we secure anybody else?</p>

            <h1>Is it innovation or are you just making your life worse?</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-01-21"></time>
            <p>The entire tech industry suffers from this one cognitive bias: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-innovation_bias">Pro-innovation bias</a>. Just because it’s new or innovative does not mean it’s any good; in fact, it’s probably awful. There are already 109 ways to skin a cat—do we really need 110 (<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd: Standards</a>)? In fact, why are you even skinning a cat in the first place? That's kind of a terrible thing to do for everyone involved.</p>
            <p>Is there a technologically simpler solution to this that already exists? Why are you using 12 web frameworks and six different cdn’s, three hosting providers, and ddos protection on your website? Would it be possible to make it entirely in just HTML and CSS and do some basic DNS load balancing? For the vast majority of personal or corporate websites on the internet...</p>
            <p>Yeah, there is.</p>
            <p>So why are they using all these fancy new innovative technologies? The answer is simple enough: somebody sold it to them and they forgot about it. Just like a Netflix or Amazon subscription. And they keep paying it either with real money or with tech debt. Often both because you know. Running a massively inefficient website with too many dependencies costs more money to host, loads slower, runs worse, and has more security problems among many other issues.</p>
            <p>So stop using that fancy new piece of technology. Improve the basics, learn about your options, and simplify. Because that new SIEM dashboard is not going to improve your security if you haven't covered the basics. Before you go and buy active protection services, you should harden all your systems as much as you can and then consider if punching a hole in that for log collection is even a good idea at this point. Because in a lot of cases...</p>
            <p>It’s not.</p>
            <p>If you find yourself in that situation, you will quickly realize. "Hey, I should just re-architect everything again to fix these critical security flaws I couldn't see before." Because in the process of hardening your systems, you learn about their most intimate details. And then you realize… "Oh hey, my network card is running a completely separate invisible operating system I have no control over that hasn’t been patched since 1989. Cool..." The more you learn the worse it gets.</p>
            <p>You learn more, find more gaping security flaws, bugs bugs bugs, it’s just junk. So many problems to fix. WHY CAN I MAKE ALL MY CPU’S EXPLODE? It becomes inconceivable to add more complexity to this gigantic mess. At this point, suddenly you know exactly where the true innovation is required. It’s not adding new features. It’s fixing. Fixing the gigantic mess that already exists and maybe just maybe along the way adding a new feature here and there. No more innovation.</p>

            <h1>Surrogation.</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-01-21"></time>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogation">Surrogation</a>. Metrics are not the goal why are you measuring them?</p>

<p>This is the most common problem I see in management in North America. It is everywhere. For example many Fortune 500 companies measure worker productivity by using mouse movement. This is not a measure of productivity it is a measure of how quickly your workers will get carpal tunnel. That much should be obvious to anyone who knows enough about statistics and thinks about the problem for more then a few minutes. So why are they using this useless metric for productivity instead of actually measuring the outcome? Because measuring the outcome is hard and measuring mouse movement is easy. And it’s not just easy, it’s easy to maximize. Make that metric a target and boom 500% increase in productivity every week <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law">Goodhart's law</a>.</p>

<p>Except what’s really happening? What happened is a lot of your employees bought mouse wigglers. Congratulations you just rewarded your most dishonest employees and you fired the honest ones. But it gets worse. Out of the honest ones that are left you kept the ones that are at a higher risk of carpal tunnel because they move the mouse more. That’s horrible obviously we should do the exact opposite and keep the ones with low mouse movement. Congratulations you kept your laziest employees and likely fired your highest performers. Jeez that’s horrible. It seems that minimizing or maximizing this metric just makes things worse. This is also the case whatever else you do with the metric. Maybe you should just leave it alone and stop measuring it. It’s not useful.</p>

<p>Metrics are abstractions of your performance they are not your performance. Oh you can’t objectively measure performance? Too bad. Give it up. Or if you really need to measure it? Measure it subjectively. Talk to your employees ask them what they were doing, how they did it, why they did it. Understand what they do individually to contribute to the goal. Because you can’t reduce people to metrics. Not accurately at least. And never forget. The metric is not the goal.</p>

            <h1>The Bluetooth Worm</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-01-20"></time>

    <h1>The Risk of Bluetooth enabled devices.</h1>
    <p>An assortment of new devices are equipped with Bluetooth and more specifically Bluetooth low energy, a new implementation of Bluetooth to allow longer range low power mesh communication (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478807/#__sec16title">Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology</a>) this poses an unprecedentedly massive security risk because Bluetooth has routinely proven to be vulnerable to many exploits (<a href="https://google.github.io/security-research/pocs/linux/bleedingtooth/writeup.html">BleedingTooth: Linux Bluetooth Zero-Click Remote Code Execution</a>) and not to mention that many Bluetooth enabled products never receive software updates to solve these well documented vulnerabilities. This could allow an attacker to create a Bluetooth worm, that could compromise most devices in a city by crawling from Bluetooth enabled device to Bluetooth enabled device eventually infiltrating into corporate networks through: smart watches, wearables, Bluetooth speakers or any other Bluetooth enabled device. This could allow an attacker permanent access to internal networks as we do not have the ability to re-flash, reformat or control the vast majority of these Bluetooth devices.</p>

    <p>Additionally Faraday cages in combination with strict checking of Bluetooth enabled devices entering sensitive areas is rendered ineffective due to human error and does not protect from off band non-Bluetooth attack vectors</p>

    <h1>Mitigation</h1>
    <p>Mitigation of this threat requires a holistic approach such as Bluetooth and preferably WiFi jamming inside of Faraday cage rooms, along with strict access control on USB and other connection methods to prevent infected devices in secured zones from being connected to secured computers and other devices. This should handle the information technology side of this threat with reasonable effectiveness. However, this still allows for attack vectors such as smartphones that are no longer being provided software updates by the manufacturer to gain access to sensitive data through cameras, microphones and other information acquired through all of their sensors (<a href="https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p90-aliA.pdf">Keystroke Recognition Using WiFi Signals</a>).</p>

    <p>Wireless detection is in this current environment completely infeasible as we do not have access or control over most Bluetooth devices and malicious communication between devices can be trivially hidden from view. A moderately competent attacker would also be able to prevent devices from showing obvious signs of infection such as a device exhibiting strange or unexpected behavior. The only feasible measure for detection would be a very long range Bluetooth snooping device monitoring Bluetooth traffic and doing some very advanced pattern recognition to detect possibly compromised devices; but this strategy does not mix well with most mitigation strategies and is currently prohibitively expensive.</p>

    <h1>Prevention</h1>
    <p>As I have mentioned throughout this document, the primary issue with these Bluetooth enabled devices is that they allow permanent access into our networks through our lack of access and control over these devices as we aren't able to remediate their security issues. The solution to this issue is long-term, competent, truly lifetime support and software updates for these devices. Unfortunately, manufacturers are unwilling to provide the long-term, often ten-to-forty year support required; due to the astronomical ongoing costs that this would entail. As such, the fundamental solution to this problem is open source firmware for these devices so that we have the ability to monitor and fix these glaring vulnerabilities ourselves.</p>

    <h1>Likelihood</h1>
    <p>Thankfully there have been no practical examples yet that we are aware of this large scale exploiting of Bluetooth that we are aware of. However, all the components of this attack have been individually developed and they have simply not been put together yet. Additionally, due to the difficulty of detecting this attack, it could have already happened and we have simply not noticed yet.</p>

            <h1>Network Card security. </h1>
            <time datetime="2025-06-25"></time>
            <p>
            I recently did a <a href="https://www.task.to/schedule/v3f7p4b6zhdyhz42w5flrfk9042n1b-awj77-rdbak-fdc5x-26fwb-7b2l5-bt7nz-d86l5-k57sz-93dff-9s2js-jcnbg-akbnl-93swm-yx55m-hs3sh-kga2g-wx863-zafr8-e9kza-j84jn-xakg7">Talk</a> at Task the Toronto Area Security Klatch about the security implications of a compromised network card. </p>
            <p>If you've never thought about it or really looked into it you might think: "Oh it can't be that bad. Im sure it's no big deal.".</p>
            <p> It is in fact a huge deal. </p>
            <p>This tiny computer in your computer is in fact one of the worst possible computer components that could get compromised. This is primarily because of PCI Express. PCI Express is a high speed flexible inherently trusted system scale network designed entirely with performance in mind with little regard for security. Your network card is architecturally the sole thing that sits between that and the internet. </p>
            <p>Defense in depth is not an option. This is a single critical point of failure. </p>
            <p><a href="https://youtu.be/UNlz_p1PvIg">That no one thinks about.</a></p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNlz_p1PvIg" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe>
            <p>Now if the alarms are not already blaring inside your head. For those not already aware being connected to PCI express as a network card inherently means you have the ability to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">DMA access</a> as it is part of how they operate. That means your network card can arbitrarily read and write to your system's memory with little to no restriction. </p>
            <p>But wait it gets worse! PCI express supports point to point communication. Meaning that your compromised network card can communicate directly to and compromise your other network card over PCIe. Depending on the system architecture they can even do this without any involvement from the CPU or PCIe root complex. Meaning that they can entirely bypass the operating system in many cases. </p>
            <p>This means that even monitoring the PCIe bus with hyper advanced detection methods can be entirely evaded. With these two features combined you could remotely over the internet in an entirely undetectable manner bypassing every firewall, infiltrate every machine on the network and dump all the sensitive information in ram and send in back over the internet. </p>
            <p>Now you should be thinking: "Oh this is pretty bad this is a huge problem." </p>
            <p>But it gets worse. Because if the PCIe devices stay powered on like is the case with wake on Lan functionality enabled you can actually do this attack while all the systems are powered off. </p>
            <p>Meaning a state actor that can pull this off for all available network cards would be able to fully comprimise every device and computer vaguely connected to the internet at once with absolutely zero indicators of comprimise and obtain full control over every one of them. </p>
            <p>Detection after the fact is not even viable since network card firmware verification is not even a reliable indicator of comprimise beacause of in network card memory exploits evading it. </p>
            <p>Despite all the fiddly little details inherent to computer hardware like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC's</a> and various architectural differences that can make comprimising these devices more difficult due to factors like resource constrained enviroments. </p>
            <p>The conclusion remains the same. You are boned! And there is very little you can do about it.
